# Product Date Added

## Description
The Product Date Added extension is for CMS Opencart 3.x Admin Panel. It allows to display and edit the date adding products. Also allows to filter and sort products by the date added.

The extension has been tested with OC 3.0.2.0 only, but should work with other OC 3.x versions.
